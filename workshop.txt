[h2] HouseMember Election [/h2]
[list]
	[*] Candidates: Members of the House
	[*] Electors  : direct vassals
[/list]
A person with Detractor Trait may select an inappropriate candidate in an election.
Current rulers are given voting rights based on the number of vassals they have.
If he is considered a good ruler by his vassals, his voting rights increase.
Conversely, if the vassals perceive him to be a bad ruler, his voting rights are reduced.
Vassals are given votes according to their military strength relative to the current ruler.
Voting rights are increased or decreased depending on various factors, such as if the person is a horrible person, imprisons the current ruler, or is a regent of the current ruler.
Commonly, legitimacy is considered important, and if it is low, voting rights are reduced.
[b] The person elected will also take over the HoF and the patriarch's position from his/her predecessor. [/b]
